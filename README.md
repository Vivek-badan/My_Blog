# üåê Django Blog Project

Welcome to my **Django Blog Project**! This is a dynamic blog platform where users can read posts, explore all published content, and easily navigate between individual posts and the home page. Built with a focus on simplicity and functionality, the project demonstrates how Django can be used to manage a backend system efficiently.



## ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Posts**: The blog contains 4 posts, each with its unique content, title, and publish date.
- **Back to Home Button**: Easily navigate back to the homepage from any post using the "Back to Home" button.
- **View All Posts**: Users can view all available posts in an organized layout, making it easy to browse the content.

## üöÄ How It Works

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of recent posts.
- **Post View**: Clicking on a post title will take you to a detailed view of the post.
- **Navigation**: Use the "Back to Home" button to return to the main list of posts.
- **Explore More**: The "View All Posts" section allows users to browse through all available blog posts.
